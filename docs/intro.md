# Intro
This is a list of optional extended conventions for [Referential Sieve](https://hackmd.io/@timotree3/BJpY7h0st). All conventions depend on context and the current game state; they may not apply in certain situations if you trust that your partner is giving optimal clues.


## Getting Started
Start with the [basic conventions](./basics/play-clues). Despite naming similarities, there are differences between certain conventions and H-Group, as well as Referential Sieve for 3+ players. Use the challenge questions at the end of each page to test your knowledge.

## Terminology
This guide uses Alice and Bob to refer to the two players, but all conventions apply to both players. No one is designated as "Alice".
