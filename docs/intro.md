# Intro
This is a list of optional extended conventions for [Referential Sieve](https://hackmd.io/@timotree3/BJpY7h0st). All conventions depend on context and the current game state; they may not apply in certain situations if you trust that your partner is giving optimal clues.

## Getting Started
Start with the [basic conventions](./basics/play-clues). Despite naming similarities, there are differences between certain conventions and H-Group, as well as Referential Sieve for 3+ players. Use the challenge questions at the end of each page to test your knowledge.

## Terminology
This guide uses Alice and Bob to refer to the two players, but all conventions apply to both players. No one is designated as "Alice".

## Document Format
The conventions and strategies in this document are written as rules rather than logical decisions with reasoning. This reduces the amount of text on the page, making it easier to get started and refer to sections without needing to scroll a lot.

If you're interested in the reasons behind each convention, some discussion is included at the bottom of each page. Reading these sections aren't necessary in order to start playing!
