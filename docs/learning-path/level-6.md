# Level 6 - Elimination

### Elimination Notes
Global elimination notes are written when:
- a delayed playable card (or 2) is called to discard
- a delayed playable card (or 2) is given *Permission To Discard* while there were 2+ clues

In other situations, elimination may not apply, or even if it does (e.g. from an unexpected play), it does not count as providing a safe action.

## Special Discards

### Sarcastic Discard

- This is [a similar convention to the one in H-Group](https://hanabi.github.io/level-3#the-sarcastic-discard), but not the same.
- The duplicate is promised in the rightmost possible position.
    - If the duplicate is not in the rightmost position, a *Sarcastic Discard* cannot be performed.

### Gentleman's Discard

- This is [a similar convention to the one in H-Group](https://hanabi.github.io/level-10#the-gentlemans-discard), but not the same.
- The duplicate is promised in the rightmost possible position.
- We also allow *Layered Gentleman's Discards*.

### Baton Discard

- This is [a similar convention to the one in H-Group](https://hanabi.github.io/level-10#the-baton-discard), but not the same.
- The location of the duplicate is not promised, other than that it is not in slot 1, since it would get *Permission to Discard*.

### Trash Order Chop Move

- This is [a similar convention to the one in H-Group](https://hanabi.github.io/level-14#the-trash-order-chop-move-tocm), but not the same.
- Known trash should be discarded from right-to-left.
