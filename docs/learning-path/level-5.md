# Level 5 - Emergency Situations

## Conventions

### Zero Clue Safety Promise
- When Alice uses the last clue, she promises at least one safe discard in Bob's hand (referred to as *ZCSP*).
	- From highest to lowest priority, the possible targets are known trash, leftmost unclued and not *Chop Moved*, and least likely to be critical.
- When Alice uses the last clue and all of Bob's cards are critical, Bob's next draw is *ZCSP*.

### Zero Clue Free Choice Extra Discard
- At 0 clues, if Alice has free choice between playing and discarding trash (including *PTD* or *ZCSP*), playing promises Bob's slot 1 to be trash.
- This can give Bob *Free Choice* to give Alice an *Extra Discard* as well.

### Bomb Lock
- Bombing a card with *PTD* or bombing known trash locks the other player.

### Scream Lock
- Discarding chop or known trash while having a globally known playable (outside of *SDCMs* at 0 clues) locks the other player.

### Sacrifice Unlock
- Sacrificing a card to unlock yourself can only be done immediately after being locked. This does not promise a *Baton* or *Gentleman's Discard*.

### Sacrifice Scream Lock
- Sacrificing a card on a turn after that locks the other player.
