# Level 8 - Advanced Moves

## Special Moves

### Self-Connecting Priority
- If a player has two playable cards, one of which connects to their own hand and the other doesn't connect to anything, playing the connecting card is often better.
- Thus, playing the non-connecting card is a *Priority Prompt* on the rightmost card that could reasonably be the connecting card, or a *Priority Finesse/Bluff* on the leftmost unclued card.

## Conventions

### Quasi-Locked
- If Alice is given a *Referential Discard Clue* and could be discarding a possibly good card while Bob has permission to discard or known trash, she is allowed to stall for 1 turn by giving a *Fill-In Clue* to Bob or a direct colour clue (focusing leftmost). This is **not** additionally referential.
- If Bob plays, it is treated as *Unlock Promise* on Alice, targeting the card called to discard. Otherwise, Bob should discard.
- This prevents the situation where Alice is forced to discard a 1-away card that connects through an unknown card in Bob's hand.
