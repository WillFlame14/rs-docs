# Muddy Rainbow

### Mud Clues - same as H-Group
- This is the [same convention as in H-Group](https://hanabi.github.io/variant-specific/muddy-rainbow-cocoa-rainbow#mud-clues).
- A colour clue retouching only rainbow cards is a *Tempo Clue*, with the rightmost colour indicating the rightmost touched card, and shifting to the left.
- For example, in a 5 suit Muddy Rainbow game:
	- Blue would be the rightmost muddy rainbow card,
	- Green would shift 1 to the left,
	- Yellow would shift 2 to the left, and 
	- Red would shift 3 spaces to the left, with wraparound.
