# Intro

Many of these are taken from [sodium's score-hunting doc](https://hackmd.io/@sodiumdebt/scorehunt), with minor tweaks. Thanks to sodium and hallmark for introducing these to me!

Unlike the corresponding H-Group variant docs, not all variants have their own page. Instead, a page is dedicated for a particular variant *quality*, and variants containing that quality will add those conventions. For example, a game of *Muddy Rainbow* is both brownish and rainbowish, so it uses all of the conventions on both pages, as well as any specific conventions for itself.

## General Principles

### Highest Lie Principle
- When lying about promised cards (e.g. *Pink Promise*), prefer to lie with the highest rank/colour available.

### Good Touch Play
- If unknown cards have been sitting around for a long time without a *Tempo Clue* and it is now endgame, the rightmost is promised to be playable.
