# Brownish

These apply to variants with a suit that is touched by no ranks, such as Brown or Null.

### Brownish Save
- A clue retouching the leftmost previously-ranked card is a save on slot 1. This overrides *No-Info Double Bluff*.

### Unclued Browns
- Cards that can be brown are always unclued, as if they were null. This means that they can always be referred into and out of to get plays/discards.
- In brownish + rainbowish variants, revealing a card to be rainbow instead of brown makes it clued again. Such a clue should be interpreted as if the revealed-rainbow cards were clued for the first time.

### Trash Chop Move
- A clue revealing trash causes a *Chop Move* on slot 1. This overrides *Trash Push* unless the receiver is *Loaded* or slot 1 cannot be brown.

### Loaded 1's Order Chop Move
- Playing a 1 out of order *Chop Moves* cards as if the other player was not loaded.
- This can be used to save brown cards that would not get a `[cm]` note otherwise.
- This overrides the *Loaded 1's Order Discard*.
