# Other Variants

### Ambigous Prism Tempo Clue
- This is the [same convention as in H-Group](https://hanabi.github.io/variant-specific/prism/#the-ambiguous-prism-tempo-clue).
- Colour is a *Tempo Clue* on the right card, rank is a *Tempo Clue* on the left card.

### Double Zero Clue Safety Promise
- In *Clue Starved*, two discards are needed to regain 1 clue. Thus, 2 safe cards are promised in the receiver's hand when the last clue is used.

### 1's Play Promise
- A 1 clue on turn 1 always indicates playable 1s (left to right in all variants except *Pink*-ish).
- This applies to the *Reversed* and *Up and Down* variants.

### Reversed 1's Save
- A 1 clue after turn 1 in *Reversed* always has to be respected as touching the reversed 1.

### Up or Down Loaded Direct Colour Clues
- In *Up or Down*, a colour clue while loaded means that the leftmost touched card can start the stack. If the stack for that colour has already started, the clue is treated as a normal *Referential Play Clue*.
- If a *Loaded Direct Colour Clue* is given while the giver is loaded on the same colour, the receiver should respond with the clue matching the card.
	- colour for START cards (giver should play START next)
	- rank for 1/5 cards (giver should respond with colour if receiver has START, otherwise giver should play their own card next)
- If giver plays, the receiver receives *PTD* on the leftmost unclued slot. Thus, giver can follow up with a rank clue after receiver responds if slot 2 is not safe, which is **not** loaded.
