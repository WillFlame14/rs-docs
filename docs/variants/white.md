# Whitish

These apply to variants with a suit that is touched by no colours, such as White or Null.

### No-Info Single Bluffs
- All no-info clues, such as the [*No-Info Double Bluff*](../learning-path/level-2#the-no-info-double-bluff), now only get 1 card to play instead of 2.

### Whitish Play
- In locked situations where a no-info clue looks like a stall, a colour clue retouching the leftmost previously-coloured card is a play on slot 1.

### Whitish Notes
- Giving a direct rank clue to slot 1 or performing a *No-Info Single Bluff* promises slot 2 is whitish.
- Unless proven non-whitish later, *Referential Play Clues* skip over this card as long as no new whitish cards have played.
