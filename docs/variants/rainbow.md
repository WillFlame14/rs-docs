# Rainbowish

These apply to variants with a suit that is touched by all colours, such as Rainbow or Omni.

### Rainbow Promise
- When free choice is available as a *Referential Play Clue*, a focused rainbow card is promised to be the rank matching the colour given.
- For example, in a 5 suit Rainbow game:
	- Blue would promise m5/m1,
	- Green would promise m4,
	- Yellow would promise m3, and 
	- Red would promise m2.
