# Basic Principles

## Save Principle

- Critical and playable cards should never be discarded.

## Sieve Principle

- Cards that will become useful should be sieved in, while trash cards should not.

## Good Touch Principle

- When cluing, only cards that will eventually become useful should be touched.
- This helps the clue receiver narrow down what cards they have in their hand.
- Sometimes, a card cannot be targeted without violating good touch. This is acceptable; it is much more important to save or play the targeted cards.
